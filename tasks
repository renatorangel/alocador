Schedule all of the classes in the department for a given semester: specify the time and room for each class. 

same instructor can't teach two different classes at the same time.

The general constraint is that two classes should not be scheduled at the same time if they are likely to be taken concurrently
For example, CSC electives should not be scheduled concurrently if at all possible. 

Dr. Shade does not like TR classes, 

classes that meet early in the morning

lecture classes that are held in a computer lab

A class may be partially specified: for example, CSC 131 must be a TR class in Cheek 209 or Cheek 210

No instructor should have more than two classes in a row.

No instructor should have consecutive classes in different buildings.
